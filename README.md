### Hola! 👋

  -✨ I am a student of Geomatics Engineering and Data Science in Valencia, Spain.
  -✨ I am very interested in automation mathematics as well as data structures and algorithms. 
  -✨ I am learning how to automate surveying and how to use geo-referenced data to be able to make maps.
  -✨ Another thing I love to work on is predictive and descriptive models in which artificial intelligence models are used.

### Open Source 🖥️

  -🎲 The language I am most used to programming in is Python, with more than four years of experience. 
     In this language I have a very advanced level and a lot of experience with libraries.
     
  -🎲 Now I am also learning to program in Rust, so at the moment I have a fairly basic level, 
     but I think it can be very useful and bring more consistency to Python programs.
